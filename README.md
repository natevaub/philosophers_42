42 Philosophers
The 42 Philosophers project is an implementation of the classical synchronization problem known as the 
Dining Philosophers problem. The goal of the project is to explore concurrent programming and 
synchronization techniques using threads and mutexes.

Description
In this project, a group of philosophers sit around a circular table with bowls of spaghetti in front of 
them. The table is set with a limited number of forks that the philosophers use to eat the spaghetti. 
However, each philosopher requires two forks to eat.

The challenge is to design a program that allows the philosophers to alternate between thinking and eating 
without causing any deadlocks or resource conflicts. The project requires implementing a solution that 
ensures the fair allocation of forks and prevents deadlock situations.

Features
Simulates the behavior of multiple philosophers and their interactions with forks.
Implements the necessary synchronization mechanisms to avoid deadlocks.
Provides a graphical representation or real-time updates to visualize the state of the philosophers and 
forks.
Supports customizable parameters such as the number of philosophers, thinking/eating durations, and more.
